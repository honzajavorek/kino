## Why

I want a dedicated calendar in my Google Calendar where I can see current film screenings at the cinemas I like to visit. I'd like to be able to turn this calendar on or off as needed. Since I'm a family man, I need to know the duration of each film. I'd also like a direct link to CSFD.cz to check what the film is about.
